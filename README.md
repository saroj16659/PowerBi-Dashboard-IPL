The dashboard is also designed to be interactive, with users able to filter into the data to gain deeper insights.

One of the key features of the IPL dashboard is the use of complex DAX formulas to calculate metrics such as batting averages, bowling averages, boundaries, sixes and strike rates. These formulas are used to derive insights from the raw data, and are critical to the accuracy and reliability of the dashboard.

The dashboard also makes use of a variety of visualization types, including cards, tables, and multi-row cards. These visualizations are designed to provide different perspectives on the data, and to enable users to quickly identify trends and patterns.

The cards on the dashboard provide a high-level overview of key metrics such as the total number of matches played, the total number of runs scored, and the total number of wickets taken, top boundaries, sixes, etc. These cards are designed to be easy to read and provide a quick snapshot of the most important data.

Finally, the multi-row cards on the dashboard provide detailed information on seasonal records such as orange caps, purple caps, highest strike rate, fours, sixes, dots balls, etc. These cards are designed to be easy to read and provide a quick snapshot of the most important data.

Overall, the IPL dashboard created using Power BI is a powerful visualization tool for analyzing IPL data. It provides users with a comprehensive view of the data, with a range of interactive visualizations and complex DAX formulas to help them gain deeper insights into the data.
